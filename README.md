# Recommender-System

I have built a recommender system on Movie ratings database with 1Million entries. I tried out three approaches - 
1. Similarity Matrix (Cosine Similarity)
2. Matrix Factorization approach using SVD
3. Variational Autoencoders - this was just an experiment, where I tried to implement a paper, although it did not give me great results.
